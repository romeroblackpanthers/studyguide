	<h1>Supreme Court Cases</h1>

<h2 id="scottsandford">1857 - Dred Scott v. Sanford</h2>
<p><strong>Background:</strong> Dred Scott was a slave in Missouri. From 1833 to 1843, he resided in Illinois and the Wisconsin Territory (present-day Minnesota) - where slavery was outlawed by the Missouri Compromise. After returning to Missouri, Scott sued for his freedom in the Missouri state courts, claiming that his residence in free territories had made him free. Scott initially won in the Missouri courts, but the Missouri Supreme Court, in violation of their own precedent, overturned those rulings. Scott then appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court. John Sandford, acting on behalf of his sister (Scott's 'owner'), argued that no Negro who is a slave or descendant of slaves could be a United States citizens in the sense of Article 3 of the Constitution, so Scott did not even have the right to use the courts to seek his freedom.<br>
<br>
<strong>Chief Justice:</strong> Roger Taney <br>
<strong>Issues:</strong> states' rights, jurisdiction, slavery, property rights, and substantive due process<br>
<strong>Articles/Amendment Involved:</strong> Article 3 Section 2, 5th Amendment<br>
<strong>Question:</strong> Was Dred Scott a free U.S. citizen with rights to sue, or a slave?<br>
<strong>Decision:</strong> 7-2 for Sandford<br>
<strong>Opinion written by:</strong> Taney<br>
<br>
<strong>Conclusion:</strong> Taney reached the conclusion that no person of African descent could be a citizen of the U.S. for Article 3 purposes. Under Article 3, only a citizen of the U.S. could be a citizen of a state. If a person was not a citizen, then they did not have the right to sue in the federal court. This meant that the ruling by the Missouri Supreme Court was upheld and Scott was a slave. Taney also cited the 5th Amendment that forbids Congress from seizing personal property (a slave was considered property) without proper compensation. The court then held that the Missouri Compromise was unconstitutional because it banned slavery in territories, which was something Congress did not have the power to do. This was further reasoning why Scott could not be declared a free man. The outcome of this case so divided the country that it is cited as one of the main factors leading to the Civil War. Justice Benjamin R. Curtis was so appalled by the decision that he resigned from the court. Over the years, scholars have denounced the decision as the worst Supreme Court decision ever made.

<h2 id="civilrightscases">1883 - Civil Rights Cases</h2>
<p><strong>Background:</strong> Five cases combined together to argue against the Civil Rights Act of 1875 which banned racial discrimination in access to public services. The African American plaintiffs were suing theaters, hotels, and transit companies, for refusing to allow them service. The case questioned whether Congress had the authority to regulate private affairs under the 14th and 13th Amendments.<br>
<br>
<strong>Chief Justice:</strong> Morrison Waite<br>
<strong>Issues:</strong> states' rights and civil rights<br>
<strong>Articles/Amendment Involved:</strong> 10th, 13th, and 14th Amendments<br>
<strong>Question:</strong> Does the Civil Rights Act of 1875 violate the 10th Amendment of the Constitution which reserves all powers not granted to the national government to the states or to the people?<br>
<strong>Decision:</strong> 8-1 for defendants<br>
<strong>Opinion written by:</strong> Bradley<br>
<strong>Dissent written by:</strong> Harlan<br>
<br>
<strong>Conclusion:</strong> The majority ruled that the 14th Amendment did not permit the federal government to prohibit discriminatory behavior by private parties. The court ruled that the Civil Rights Act of 1875 was unconstitutional because it exceeded Congress's authority under the 14th Amendment. Therefore, private acts of racial discrimination within private businesses could not be controlled by the national government.
</p>

<h2 id="yickwo">1886 - Yick Wo v. Hopkins</h2>
<p><strong>Background:</strong> San Francisco in 1880 required all laundries in wooden buildings to hold a permit issued by the Board of Supervisors. Not a single Chinese owner was granted a permit. Yick Wo and Wo Lee wre imprisoned by Sheriff Peter Hopkins for refusing to pay the fine for owning a business without a permit.<br>
<br>
<strong>Chief Justice:</strong> Morrison Waite<br>
<strong>Issues:</strong> equal protection, discrimination, and municipal law<br>
<strong>Articles/Amendment Involved:</strong> 14th Amendment<br>
<strong>Question:</strong> Did the unequal enforcement of the city ordinance violate Yick Wo and Wo Lee's rights under the Equal Protection Clause?<br>
<strong>Decision:</strong> unanimous for Yick Wo<br>
<strong>Opinion written by:</strong> T. Stanley Matthews<br>
<br>
<strong>Conclusion:</strong> The law itself was not discriminatory, however, the enforcement of the law violated the Equal Protection Clause. Therefore, Yick Wo would be allowed to get the permit for the laundry service.
</p>

<h2 id="plessyferguson">1896 - Plessy v. Ferguson</h2>
<p><strong>Background:</strong> Louisiana enacted a law, the Separate Car Act, that required separate railway cars for blacks and whites. In 1892, Homer Plessy, who was 7/8 Caucasian, bought a ticket for the "white" car of a Louisiana train, making sure the conductor knew of his mixed race. His hope was to be arrested for refusing to move and to use the incident as a test case supported by the Citizens' Committee, a civil rights group from New Orleans, to test the constitutionality of the Separate Car Law. He was arrested. After losing his case in the Louisiana courts, decided by Judge John Howard Ferguson, he requested a review from the Supreme Court. <br>
<br>
<strong>Chief Justice:</strong> Melville Fuller<br>
<strong>Issues:</strong> equal protection versus states' rights, segregation, and separate but equal doctrine<br>
<strong>Articles/Amendment Involved:</strong> 13th and 14th Amendment<br>
<strong>Question:</strong> Are state segregation laws a violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment?<br>
<strong>Decision:</strong> 7-1 for Ferguson<br>
<strong>Opinion written by:</strong> Henry Brown<br>
<strong>Dissent written by:</strong> John Harlan<br>
<br>
<strong>Conclusion:</strong> The court upheld state imposed racial segregation, deciding that the state law was constitutional. The case established the separate but equal doctrine, i.e., separate facilities for blacks and whites were allowed by the 14th Amendment so long as they were equal. Brown said that, while the 14th Amendment was intended to establish equality for the races with respect to the law, it did not apply to social situations such as railroad cars or waiting rooms. The majority decided that segregation does not in itself constitute unlawful discrimination. Justice Harlan, in the lone dissenting opinion, wrote that the Constitution, "is color-blind, and neither knows nor tolerates classes among citizens." He maintained that 'separate' was unconstitutional as it required a dual system which itself implied an inequality. The separate but equal doctrine would later be overthrown by <em>Brown v. Board of Education</em> in 1954.

<h2 id="meyernebraska">1923 - Meyer v. Nebraska</h2>
<p><strong>Background:</strong> Nebraska law prohibited teaching grade school children any language other than English. Mr. Meyer was charged with violating the Siman Act after he taught German to his students.<br>
<br>
<strong>Chief Justice:</strong> William Taft<br>
<strong>Issues:</strong> due process<br>
<strong>Articles/Amendment Involved:</strong> 14th Amendment<br>
<strong>Question:</strong> Did the Nebraska statute violate the 14th Amendment's Due Process Clause?<br>
<strong>Decision:</strong> 7-2 for Meyer<br>
<strong>Opinion written by:</strong> McReynolds<br>
<strong>Dissent written by:</strong> Holmes<br>
<br>
<strong>Conclusion:</strong> The Nebraska law was found unconstitutional, reasoning that that it violated the liberty protected by the Due Process Clause. It includes the right for teachers to teach German as it allows parents to control the upbringing of their child.
</p>

<h2 id="missourigaines">1938 - Missouri ex rel Gaines v. Canada</h2>
<p><strong>Background:</strong> Lloyd Gaines, an African American, wanted to attend the University of Missouri Law School, but he was refused. Gaines sued as it violated his 14th Amendment Equal Protection Clause.<br>
<br>
<strong>Chief Justice:</strong> Charles E. Hughes<br>
<strong>Issues:</strong> Equal Protection Clause<br>
<strong>Articles/Amendment Involved:</strong> 14th Amendment<br>
<strong>Question:</strong> Did Gaines' denial of admission to the University of Missouri Law School violate the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment?<br>
<strong>Decision:</strong> 7-2 for Gaines<br>
<strong>Opinion written by:</strong> Charles Hughes<br>
<strong>Dissent written by:</strong> James McReynolds<br>
<br>
<strong>Conclusion:</strong> States that provide a school for white students must also provide an in-state school for blacks by allowing blacks to go to the school with whites or create a separate school. It did not overturn <em>Plessy v. Ferguson</em> but did make schools provide equal opportunities for education.
</p>

<h2 id="shelleykraemer">1948 - Shelley v. Kraemer</h2>
<p><strong>Background:</strong> A Missouri and Michigan neighborhood enacted an agreement to prevent African Americans and Asian Americans from living in the area. After an African American family, the Shelley's, moved into a neighborhood, Kraemer sued to stop them from being allowed to move in. The Detroit suit was at the same time over the same issue, so the Supreme Court combined the appeals.<br>
<br>
<strong>Chief Justice:</strong> Fred Vinson<br>
<strong>Issues:</strong> Equal Protection Clause<br>
<strong>Articles/Amendment Involved:</strong> 14th Amendment<br>
<strong>Question:</strong> Does the enforcement of a racially restrictive covenant violate the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment?<br>
<strong>Decision:</strong> 6-0 for Shelley, 3 justices abstained<br>
<strong>Opinion written by:</strong> Fred Vinson<br>
<br>
<strong>Conclusion:</strong> The court decided that racially restrictive agreements are allowed as they do not violate the 14th Amendment, yet the private parties can't seek judicial enforcement of the agreement. Therefore, the court found in favor of the Shelley family.
</p>

<h2 id="sweattpainter">1950 - Sweatt v. Painter</h2>
<p><strong>Background:</strong> Herman Sweatt applied to the University of Texas Law School but he was restricted admission as there was not a separate, colored school. He was immediately denied under Texas' Jim Crow laws.<br>
<br>
<strong>Chief Justice:</strong> Fred M. Vinson<br>
<strong>Issues:</strong> Equal Protection Clause<br>
<strong>Articles/Amendment Involved:</strong> 14th Amendment<br>
<strong>Question:</strong> Did the University of Texas' admissions scheme violate Sweatt's Equal Protection Clause?<br>
<strong>Decision:</strong> 9-0 for Sweatt<br>
<strong>Opinion written by:</strong> Fred Vinson<br>
<br>
<strong>Conclusion:</strong> The court ruled in favor of Sweatt and ruled the situation unequal as there was no separate law school. The court said that a separate school would be inferior in a number of areas, including faculty, course variety, library facilities, and legal writing opportunities. They found it would harm a student's ability to learn to be a lawyer and compete in the legal field.
</p>

<h2 id="briggselliott">1954 - Briggs v. Elliott</h2>
<p><strong>Background:</strong> Reverend Joseph De Laine led efforts on behalf of the Briggs family in Summerton, South Carolina (included in Clarendon County School District Number 22) to force the district to provide transportation for its black students to the segregated school. After the district stated it was too much of a burden for white taxpayers to buy a bus for the black students, the NAACP and Thurgood Marshall turned the case into one questioning segregation altogether. The case was heard by a three-judge panel including noted integrationist Julius Waring. Segregation was upheld by the rest of the panel and apealed to the Supreme Court where it would be the first of the Brown cases to be heard.<br>
<br>
<strong>Chief Justice:</strong> Earl Warren<br>
<strong>Issues:</strong> Separate but Equal, school segregation<br>
<strong>Articles/Amendment Involved:</strong> 14th Amendment, Equal Protection Clause<br>
<strong>Question:</strong> Should a South Carolina school district be able to follow a District Court order to improve schools for black students in order to meet separate but equal standards or should separation in schools be ended entirely?<br>
<strong>Decision:</strong> The court vacated the District Court decision but decided not to rule on the case until the end of the session, when it would be ruled on with a group of similar cases (<em>Brown v. Board of Education</em>). Douglass and Black believed the case should be heard and decided as scheduled.<br>
<strong>Opinion written by:</strong> Per Curiam<br>
<br>
<strong>Conclusion:</strong> Based on the ruling in <em>Brown v. Board of Education</em>, segregated education in South Carolina was ruled unconstitutional based on the 14th Amendment.
</p>

<h2 id="hernandeztexas">1954 - Hernandez v. Texas</h2>
<p><strong>Background:</strong> Hernandez was found guilty of murdering Joe Espinoza by an all-white grand jury. He sued as there were no Mexican Americans on the jurt as they were not allowed to serve on any jury in the country. He continually had to repeal the ruling as the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals found that Mexican Americans were within the classifications of the white race.<br>
<br>
<strong>Chief Justice:</strong> Earl Warren<br>
<strong>Issues:</strong> Equal Protection Clause<br>
<strong>Articles/Amendment Involved:</strong> 6th and 14th Amendment<br>
<strong>Question:</strong> Is it denial of the 14th Amendment Equal Protection Clause to try a defendant of a particular race or ethnicity before a jury where all persons of his race or ancestry have, because of that race or ethnicity, been excluded by the state?<br>
<strong>Decision:</strong> unanimous for Hernandez<br>
<strong>Opinion written by:</strong> Earl Warren<br>
<br>
<strong>Conclusion:</strong> Chief Justice Warren ruled that the 14th Amendment protects those beyond whites and Negros and that Mexican Americans should be protected. Mexican Americans were allowed onto juries.
</p>

<h2 id="brownboard">1954 & 1955 - Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka (Brown I and Brown II)</h2>
<p><strong>Background:</strong> Beginning in the mid-1930s, the NAACP filed suits attempting to reverse racial segregation. Plessy was seen as the major obstacle in their quest, and its reversal was a major goal. Thus, it was one of many similar cases filed around the country. In this case, Oliver Brown sued because his daughter was denied admission to a 'white' school only five blocks away. <em>Brown I</em> declared racial discrimination in public education unconstitutional (merits). In <em>Brown</em>, the court had to decide how to implement (relief) its decision. This was the more complicated of the two parts. The court addressed the issue of implementing relief due to the long-standing nature of racial discrimination in public schools, as upheld by <em>Plessy</em> in 1896.<br>
<br>
<strong>Chief Justice:</strong> Earl Warren<br>
<strong>Issues:</strong> civil rights, desegregation, separate but equal<br>
<strong>Articles/Amendment Involved:</strong> 14th Amendment Equal Protection Clause<br>
<strong>Question:</strong> Are separate but equal school facilities unconstitutional? How should the principles in <em>Brown I</em> be implemented?<br>
<strong>Decision:</strong> unanimous for Brown<br>
<strong>Opinion written by:</strong> Earl Warren<br>
<br>
<strong>Conclusion:</strong> Courts in Delaware had already ruled that black-only schools were inferior to white schools, their courts dismissed separate but equal and it was not further challenged, so these cases did not reach the Supreme Court. Separate but equal was inherently unequal and violated the 14th Amendment. This case reversed <em>Plessy</em>. The court requested a further argument to determine how the initial case designated in <em>Brown I</em> be implemented. The result was <em>Brown II</em> in which the court held that remedying the problems identified in <em>Brown I</em> would require varied local solutions. Most of the responsibility was placed back on local school authorities and on the courts, which had originally heard school segregation cases. The Supreme Court urged local entities to act on the new principles promptly and to move toward full compliance 'with all deliberate speed.' This phrase however was not defined and allowed many southern states to drag their heels on implementation. This decision applied to government entities and not civilian establishments such as restaurants, movie theaters, work places, etc. <em>Brown I & II</em> did not eliminate all discrimination.
</p>

<h2 id="browdergayle">1956 - Browder v. Gayle</h2>
<p><strong>Background:</strong> The bus boycott in Montgomery started after Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat. During the boycott, the NAACP challenged racial segregation on the bus system. Gayle was the mayor of Montgomery.<br>
<br>
<strong>Chief Justice:</strong> Earl Warren<br>
<strong>Issues:</strong> Equal Protection Clause, segregation, and public transportation<br>
<strong>Articles/Amendment Involved:</strong> 14th Amendment<br>
<strong>Question:</strong> Did the District Court mistakenly strike down the racially separate but equal bus system in Montgomery, Alabama?<br>
<strong>Decision:</strong> unanimous for Browder<br>
<strong>Opinion written by:</strong> none, case was reaffirmed<br>
<br>
<strong>Conclusion:</strong> The court ruled similarly to the three-judge panel for Alabama's District Court; the segregation of public transportation buses in Montgomery violated the 14th Amendment.
</p>

<h2 id="heartatlanta">1964 - Heart of Atlanta Motel Inc. v. U.S.</h2>
<p><strong>Background:</strong> Heart of Atlanta Motel refused to accept African Americans, which violated the Civil Rights Act. Title II forbids racial discrimination by places of public accommodation.<br>
<br>
<strong>Chief Justice:</strong> Earl Warren<br>
<strong>Issues:</strong> Title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Commerce Clause, and discrimination<br>
<strong>Articles/Amendment Involved:</strong> 14th Amendment<br>
<strong>Question:</strong> Did Congress, in passing Title II of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, exceed its commerce clause powers by depriving motels, such as the Heart of Atlanta, of the right to choose their own customers?<br>
<strong>Decision:</strong> Unanimous for Clark<br>
<strong>Opinion written by:</strong> Tom Clark<br>
<br>
<strong>Conclusion:</strong> The court ruled that the Commerce Clause allowed them to regulate incidents of commerce. Specifically, the court stated that the motel could not select certain guests as they chose because they were involved in interstate commerce in which the federal government can regulate using Civil Rights Act of 1964.
</p>

<h2 id="lovingvirginia">1967 - Loving v. Virginia</h2>
<p><strong>Background:</strong> Mildred Jeter, an African American woman, and Richard Loving, a white man, married in D.C. They returned to Virginia and were charged with violating a law that prohibited interracial marriage. They were found guilty and sent to jail until they appealed the case.<br>
<br>
<strong>Chief Justice:</strong> Earl Warren<br>
<strong>Issues:</strong> Equal Protection Clause<br>
<strong>Articles/Amendment Involved:</strong> 14th Amendment<br>
<strong>Question:</strong> Did Virginia's law against interracial marriage violate the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment?<br>
<strong>Decision:</strong> Unanimous for Loving<br>
<strong>Opinion written by:</strong> Earl Warren<br>
<br>
<strong>Conclusion:</strong> The court ruled in favor of Loving, stating that Virginia had no legitimate purpose to enforce this racist law on independent individuals. The court found that Virginia violated their Equal Protection Clause and Chief Justice Warren wrote, <em>"Under our Constitution, the freedom to marry or not marry a person of another race resides with the individual and cannot be infringed by the state."</em>
</p>

<h2 id="jonesmayerco">1968 - Jones v. Mayer Co.</h2>
<p><strong>Background:</strong> Joseph Jones, a black man living in Missouri, was denied the right to purchase property in a certain neighborhood. He sued the real estate company as they were discriminating against him based on his race.<br>
<br>
<strong>Chief Justice:</strong> Earl Warren<br>
<strong>Issues:</strong> 42 U.S.C. Section 1982, Civil Rights Act of 1964, and discrimination<br>
<strong>Articles/Amendment Involved:</strong> 13th Amendment<br>
<strong>Question:</strong> Did the real estate company violate a law that guarantees equal rights to all citizens making real estate transactions?<br>
<strong>Decision:</strong> 7-2 for Jones<br>
<strong>Opinion written by:</strong> Potter Stewart<br>
<strong>Dissent written by:</strong> John Harlan II<br>
<br>
<strong>Conclusion:</strong> The court ruled in favor of Jones that his rights were being violated. It overturned previous rulings such as <em>Hodges v. U.S.</em>. The court under the 13th Amendment and Section 1982 of the 42 U.S.C. Code could regulate the sale of private property to prevent racial discrimination.
</p>

<h2 id="griggsduke">1971 - Griggs v. Duke Power Co.</h2>
<p><strong>Background:</strong> Griggs sued his employer Duke Power Company as a class action suit. He was challenging a transfer policy that required employees to register a minimum score on two separate aptitude tests and have a high school diploma. He believed his rights under the Civil Rights Act; specifically, Title VII was being violated along with most of his fellow African American coworkers' rights.<br>
<br>
<strong>Chief Justice:</strong> Warren Burger<br>
<strong>Issues:</strong> Civil Rights Act of 1964 and employment discrimination<br>
<strong>Articles/Amendment Involved:</strong> 14th Amendment<br>
<strong>Question:</strong> Did the Duke Power Company transfer policy violate Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act?<br>
<strong>Decision:</strong> 8-0 for Griggs<br>
<strong>Opinion written by:</strong> Burger<br>
<strong>Dissent written by:</strong> none, but Justice Brennan did not take part in the case<br>
<br>
<strong>Conclusion:</strong> The court ruled that Duke Power Company's testing requirement prevented mostly African American employees from transferring. Neither the diploma nor the tests were necessary to confirm if one could complete the job. The transfer policy was found to be discriminatory and the court ruled in favor of Griggs and his fellow employees.
</p>

<h2 id="roewade">1973 - Roe v. Wade</h2>
<p><strong>Background:</strong> A woman in Texas, identified as only 'Jane Roe' to protect her privacy (later identified as Norma McCorvey), sought to terminate her pregnancy by abortion. Texas law prohibited abortions, except to save the woman's life. She sued, claiming that the abortion laws violated her 14th Amendment right to due process and right to privacy.<br>
<br>
<strong>Chief Justice:</strong> Warren Burger<br>
<strong>Issues:</strong> due process, privacy, abortion rights, states'rights<br>
<strong>Articles/Amendment Involved:</strong> 9th and 14th Amendment<br>
<strong>Question:</strong> Does the Constitution protect a woman's right to have an abortion?<br>
<strong>Decision:</strong> 7-2 for Roe<br>
<strong>Opinion written by:</strong> Harry A. Blackmun<br>
<br>
<strong>Conclusion:</strong> The court ruled that a woman's right to an abortion fell within the right to privacy protected by the 14th Amendment and that "the word 'person'...does not include the unborn." The conclusion gave a woman all decision rights regarding her pregnancy during the first trimester and defined different levels of state involvement for the second and third trimesters. As a result, the laws of 46 states were affected by the court's ruling. This case reshaped national politics, triggering grassroots movements and separating most of the U.S. into either pro-choice or pro-life camps. Due to the length of time involved for the ruling, McCorvey did not have the abortion and gave birth. She later claimed she was a pawn of ambitious lawyers; she became active in the pro-life movement and petitioned the Supreme Court to overturn the decision. There is national debate on this hotly contested issue to this day.
</p>

<h2 id="launichols">1974 - Lau v. Nichols</h2>
<p><strong>Background:</strong> Kinney Lau sued the school district in San Francisco for failing to provide supplemental English courses to their students. The District Court ruled in favor of the school system, as they were not violating the 14th Amendment. Lau and the others in the class action lawsuit appealed the court's decision to the Supreme Court.<br>
<br>
<strong>Chief Justice:</strong> Warren Burger<br>
<strong>Issues:</strong> Equal Protection Clause, education<br>
<strong>Articles/Amendment Involved:</strong> 14th Amendment<br>
<strong>Question:</strong> Does the school district violate the 14th Amendment when it only teaches in English and does not provide supplemental means of education for non-English speakers?<br>
<strong>Decision:</strong> unanimous for Lau<br>
<strong>Opinion written by:</strong> William Douglas<br>
<br>
<strong>Conclusion:</strong> The court ruled that yes, a school must offer classes to help non-English speakers learn the content and learn English. It would otherwise violate their 14th Amendment rights if they were deprived education due to their background.
</p>

<h2 id="plylerdoe">1982 - Plyler v. Doe</h2>
<p><strong>Background:</strong> A Texas education law stated that schools that teach undocumented children could lose funding from the state. This case was decided alongside <em>Texas v. Unnamed Alien Children</em>.<br>
<br>
<strong>Chief Justice:</strong> Warren Burger<br>
<strong>Issues:</strong> education, immigration, and equal protection<br>
<strong>Articles/Amendment Involved:</strong> 14th Amendment<br>
<strong>Question:</strong> Did the Texas Education Code violate the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment?<br>
<strong>Decision:</strong> 5-4 for Doe<br>
<strong>Opinion written by:</strong> William Brennan<br>
<strong>Dissent written by:</strong> Warren Burger<br>
<br>
<strong>Conclusion:</strong> The court ruled that it did violate the childrens' Equal Protection Clause. Even if a child is not a citizen, they are people and therefore are guaranteed protection under the 14th Amendment. The court struck down the education code, as the state could not find a strong argument as to why the immigrant children should be denied the right to education.
</p>

<h2 id="meritorvinson">1986 - Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson</h2>
<p><strong>Background:</strong> Mechelle Vinson was fired from her job at Meritor Savings Bank in Washington, D.C. After being fired, she claimed that she was being sexually harassed by her boss who had created a hostile work environment. She sued as this environment violated her Civil Rights Act, Title VII.<br>
<br>
<strong>Chief Justice:</strong> Warren Burger<br>
<strong>Issues:</strong> Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, sexual harassment, labor laws<br>
<strong>Articles/Amendment Involved:</strong> 14th Amendment<br>
<strong>Question:</strong> Did the Bank violate her rights under Title VII, specifically her right to a safe work environment? Can the Civil Rights Act prohibit such environments?<br>
<strong>Decision:</strong> unanimous for Vinson<br>
<strong>Opinion written by:</strong> William Rehnquist<br>
<br>
<strong>Conclusion:</strong> The court ruled in favor of Vinson as Title VII was not limited to economic discrimination and it was intended to create equal treatment of men and women in employment. The court ruled that the guideline of the EEOC in terms of sexual harassment was a form of discrimination.

<h2 id="bowershardwick">1986 - Bowers v. Hardwick</h2>
<p><strong>Background:</strong> Hardwick was arrested and charged with violating a Georgian law that outlawed sodomy after he was caught by a police officer having a consensual homosexual act with another adult in his bedroom. Hardwick challenged the constitutionality of the law and the Court of Appeals found in his favor. The Georgian Attorney General Michael Bowers appealed the ruling to the Supreme Court.<br>
<br>
<strong>Chief Justice:</strong> Warren Burger<br>
<strong>Issues:</strong> homosexual intercourse and Georgia's anti-sodomy law<br>
<strong>Articles/Amendment Involved:</strong> 14th Amendment<br>
<strong>Question:</strong> Does the Constitution allow rights for homosexuals to engage in consensual sodomy, thereby invalidating many state laws?<br>
<strong>Decision:</strong> 5-4 for Bowes<br>
<strong>Opinion written by:</strong> Byron White<br>
<strong>Dissent written by:</strong> Harry Blackmun and John Stevens<br>
<br>
<strong>Conclusion:</strong> The court ruled in favor of Attorney General Bowers that there was not constitutional protection for acts of sodomy. States were allowed to outlaw the practice. The ruling was later overturned by <em>Lawrence v. Texas</em> that anti-sodomy laws are unconstitutional.
</p>

<h2 id="uawjohnson">1991 - UAW v. Johnson Controls</h2>
<p><strong>Background:</strong> Johnson Controls makes batteries that produced high levels of lead which is dangerous to pregnant women. Johnson stopped allowing women to work near the batteries unless they were infertile. The district and appellate court ruled in favor of Johnson; therefore UAW appealed to the Supreme Court.<br>
<br>
<strong>Chief Justice:</strong> William Rehnquist<br>
<strong>Issues:</strong> Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Pregnancy Discrimination Act, employee rights, and women's rights<br>
<strong>Articles/Amendment Involved:</strong> 14th Amendment<br>
<strong>Question:</strong> Does a policy prohibiting pregnant or fertile women as it is dangerous for their health, fall under sexual discrimination?<br>
<strong>Decision:</strong> unanimous for UAW<br>
<strong>Opinion written by:</strong> Harry Blackmun<br>
<br>
<strong>Conclusion:</strong> The court ruled that even though the company's rule had good intentions, it was discriminatory. Since the male employees did not need to demonstrate proof of infertility, it was discriminatory towards females.
</p>

<h2 id="franklingwin">1992 - Franklin v. Gwinnett County Public Schools</h2>
<p><strong>Background:</strong> Christine Franklin was sexually harassed by her teacher, Andrew Hill. She reported it to the administrators but nothing happened from it. The teacher resigned on the condition that all matters against him were dropped. Franklin brought the lawsuit against the school district as her rights under Title IX were violated. The district and appellate court dismissed the suit, as the Civil Rights Act did not authorize an award for damages.<br>
