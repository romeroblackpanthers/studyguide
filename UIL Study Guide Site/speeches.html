<em>"Then that little man in black there, he says women can't have as much rights as men 'cause Christ wasn't a woman! Where did your Christ come from? Where did your Christ come from? From God and a woman. Man had nothing to do with him."</em>

<br>
<strong>Quotes:</strong><br>
<em>"It's time for us to submerge our differences and realize that it is best for us to first see that we have the same problem, a common problem - a problem that will make you catch hell whether you're a Baptist, or a Methodist, or a Muslim, or a nationalist. Whether you're educated or illiterate, whether you live on the boulevard or in the alley, you're going to catch hell just like I am."</em><br>

<br>
<br>
<strong>Quotes:</strong><br>
<em>"I can only defend my claim with the plea that it is better to imagine a crisis where none exists than fail to recognize one when it comes; for a crisis is a culmination of events which calls for new considerations and new decisions. A failure to answer the call may mean an opportunity lost, a possible victory postponed."</em><br>
<em>"The four Corner-stones of the foundations were laid long years ago. We read upon the first: "We demand for women education, for not a high school or college is open to her"; upon the second, "We demand for women religious liberty for in few churches is she permitted to pray or speak"; upon the third, "We demand for women the right to own property and an opportunity to earn an honest living. Only six, poorly-paid occupations are open to her, and if she is married, the wages she earns are not hers"; upon the fourth, "We demand political freedom and its symbol, the vote."</em>

<br>
<br>
<strong>Quotes:</strong><br> 
<em>"Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny. Whatever affects one directly, affects all indirectly."</em><br>
<em>"We know through painful experience that freedom is never voluntarily given by the oppressor; it must be demanded by the oppressed."</em>
</p>

EISENHOWER, President of the United States, under and by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and Statutes of the United States, including Chapter 15 of Title 10 of the United States Code, particularly sections 332, 333, and 334 thereof, do command all persons engaged in such obstruction of justice to cease and desist therefrom, and to disperse forthwith."</em>

<br>
<strong>Quotes:</strong><br>
<em>"I hope that every American, regardless of where he lives, will stop and examine his conscience about this and other related incidents. This Nation was founded by men of many nations and backgrounds. It was founded on the principle that all men are created equal, and that the rights of every man are diminished when the rights of one man are threatened."</em><br>
<em>"We are confronted primarily with a moral issue. It is as old as the scriptures and is as clear as the American Constitution. The heart of the question is whether all Americans are to be afforded equal rights and equal opportunities, whether we are going to treat our fellow Americans as we want to be treated."</em>

Hamer describes how she was removed from her home for registering and beaten in a jail after attending a voter registration workshop. The speech was nationally televised as part of the convention coverage, but was preempted by an address by President Johnson seeking to divert attention from Hamer.

<br>
<br>
<strong>Quotes:</strong><br> 
<em>"He said,"If you don't go down and withdraw your registration, you will have to leave." Said, "Then if you go down and withdraw," said, "you still might have to go because we are not ready for that in Mississippi." And I addressed him and told him and said, "I didn't try to register for you. I tried to register for myself." I had to leave that same night. On the 10th of September 1962, 16 bullets were fired into the home of Mr. and Mrs. Robert Tucker for me."</em><br>
<em>"All of this is on account of we want to register, to become first class citizens. And if the Freedom Democratic Party is not seated now, I question America. Is this America, the land of the free and the home of the brave, where we have to sleep with our telephones off the hooks because our lives be threatened daily, because we want to live as decent human beings, in America?"</em>
</p>

<br>
<br>
<strong>Quotes:</strong><br>
<em>"It is therefore a cruel irony that the President of the United States has only yesterday signed into law the most monstrous piece of legislation ever enacted by the United States Congress. It is a fraud, a sham, and a hoax."</em><br>
<em>"Georgia is a great state. Atlanta is a great city. I know you will demonstrate that greatness in November by joining Alabama and other states throughout the south in electing the next president of the United States."</em>

<strong>Quotes:</strong><br>
<em>"This great, rich, restless country can offer opportunity and education and hope to all: black and white, North and South, sharecropper and city dweller. These are the enemies: poverty, ignorance, and disease. They are the enemies and not our fellow man, not our neighbor. And these enemies too, poverty, disease, and ignorance, we shall overcome."</em><br>
<em>"The bill that I am presenting to you will be known as a civil rights bill. But, in a larger sense, most of the program I am recommending is a civil rights program. Its object is to open the city of hope to all people of all races. Because all Americans just must have the right to vote. And we are going to give them that right. All Americans must have the privileges of citizenship regardless of race."</em>

<br>
<strong>Quotes:</strong><br>
<em>"Now, then, in order to understand white supremacy we must dismiss the fallacious notion that white people can give anybody their freedom. No man can give anybody his freedom. A man is born free. You may enslave a man after he is born free, and that is in fact what this country does. It enslaves black people after they're born so that the only acts that whie people can do is to stop denying black people their freedom; that is, they must stop denying freedom. They never give it to anyone."</em><br>
<em>"And that we maintain, whether they like it or not, we gonna use the word 'Black Power' and let them address themselves to that; (applause) but that we are not goin' to wait for white people to sanction Black Power. We are tired waiting; every time black people move in this country, they're forced to defend their position before they move. It's time that the people who are supposed to be defending their position do that. That's white people. They ought to start defending themselves as to why they have oppressed and exploited us."</em>

<br>
<strong>Quotes:</strong><br>
<em>"Go out and tell your neighbors not to buy Coca-Cola in Memphis. Go by and tell them not to buy Sealtest milk. Tell them not to buy - what is the other bread? Wonder Bread. And what is the other bread company, Jesse? Tell them not to buy Hart's bread. As Jesse Jackson has said, up to now, only the garbage men have been feeling pain; now we must kind of redistribute the pain."</em><br>
<em>"Well, I don't know what will happen now. We've got some difficult days ahead. But it really doesn't matter with me now, because I've been to the mountaintop. And I don't mind. Like anybody, I would like to live - a long life; longevity has its place. But I'm not concerned about that now. I just want to do God's will. And He's allowed me to go up to the mountain. And I've looked over. And I've seen the Promised Land. I may not get there with you. But I want you to know tonight, that we, as a people, will get to the Promised Land. So I'm happy, tonight. I'm not worried about anything. I'm not fearing any man. Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord."</em>

<br>
<strong>Quotes:</strong><br>
<em>"It is for this reason that I wish to introduce today a proposal that has been before every Congress for the last 40 years and that sooner or later must become part of the basic law of the land -- the Equal Rights Amendment."</em><br>
<em>"The unspoken assumption is that women are different: They do not have executive ability, orderly minds, stability, leadership skills, and they are too emotional. It has been observed before that society, for a long time, discriminated against another minority, the blacks, on the same basis -- that they were different and inferior. The happy little homemaker and the contented 'old darky' on the plantation were both stereotypes produced by prejudice."</em>
</p>

<br>
<br>
<strong>Quotes:</strong><br>
<em>"The important thing is that we are spending this time together, considering the larger implications of a movement that some call 'feminist' but should more accurately be called humanist; a movement that is an integral part of rescuing this country from its old, expensive patterns of elitism, racism, and violence."</em><br>
<em>"The challenge to all of us, and to you men and women who are graduating today, is to live a revolution, not to die for one. There has been too much killing, and the weapons are now far too terrible. This revolution has to change consciousness, to upset the injustice of our current hierarchy by refusing to honor it, and to live a life that enforces a new social justsice."</em>
</p>

<br>
<br>
<strong>Quotes:</strong><br>
<em>"Of all the classes of people who ever lived, the American woman is the most privileged. We have the most rights and rewards, and the fewest duties. Our unique status is the result of a fortunate combination of circumstances. We have the immense good fortune to live in a civilization which respects the family as the basic unit of society. This respect is part and parcel of our laws and our customs. It is based on the fact of life -- which no legislation or agitation can erase -- that women have babies and men don't."</em><br>
<em>"Tell your Senators NOW that you want them to vote NO on the Equal Rights Amendment. Tell your television and radio stations that you want equal time to present the case FOR marriage and motherhood."</em>
</p>

<strong>Quotes:</strong><br>
<em>"There's a great deal to do. We need to construct instead of destroy. We need to inspire hope in the people for the future. Right now we have millions of people unable to find work. That inability to find work destroys the spirit. We have men, women, and youth who are skilled, who have energy and ideals, looking for work, and all they get are hand-outs."</em><br>
<em>"We need a leader that understands these problems. We need a leader to challenge, we need a leader to lead by example, to sacrifice. We need a leader who is not afraid to ask questions. We need a leader. And brothers and sisters, this is why we place in nomination the name of Governor Edmund G. Brown Jr. for President of the United States of America."</em>

<strong>Quotes:</strong><br>
<em>"The true test of Democracy is when anybody can run for anything and in this case, almost everybody is. Well, they say Democracy is a participatory process so you can't say we weren't warned..."</em><br>
<em>"Without hope not only the gays but the blacks, the seniors, the poor, the handicap, the users give up...if you help me get elected that election -- no it is not my election, it is yours -- it will mean that a green light is lit...a green light that says to all who feel lost and disenfranchised that you now can go forward -- it means hope and we -- no, you and you and you, and yes you, got to give them hope."</em>
</p>
