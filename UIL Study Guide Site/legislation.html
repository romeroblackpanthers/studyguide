<h1>Legislation</h1>

<h2 id="fifthamendment">5th Amendment</h2>
<p>This was ratified in 1791 as a part of the Bill of Rights, written by James Madison. It creates a number of guarantees such as granting the right to a grand jury, forbidding double jeopardy, protecting against self-incrimination, protecting right of eminent domain, and lastly requiring due process of law. Due process requires that all criminal and civil proceedings cannot deny a citizen life, liberty, or property.<br>
<br>
<em>"No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a grand jury, except in cases arising in the land or naval forces, or in the militia, when in actual service in time of war or public danger; nor shall any person be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb; nor shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself, nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation."</em>
</p>

<h2 id="fourteenthamendment">14th Amendment</h2>
<p>Submitted to the states for ratification on June 16, 1866 and ratified on July 28, 1968, having been ratified by the requisite number of states, it entered into force. It was brought forth during Reconstruction by Republicans looking to stop states from circumventing attempts at providing former slaves with full freedom. The 14th Amendment has become one of the most important for all civil rights issues based on its 'due process' and 'equal protection' clauses which have been used to incorporate the Bill of Rights to apply at all levels of government.<br>
<br>
<strong>Section 1</strong><br>
<em>All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside. No state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any state deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.</em>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Section 2</strong><br>
<em>Representatives shall be apportioned among the several states according to their respective numbers, counting the whole number of persons in each state, excluding Indians not taxed. But when the right to vote at any election for the choice of electors for President and Vice President of the United States, Representatives in Congress, the executive and judicial officers of a state, or the members of the legislature thereof, is denied to any of the male inhabitants of such state, being twenty-one years of age, and citizens of the United States, or in any way abridged, except for the proportion which the number of such male citizens shall bear to the whole number of male citizens twenty-one years of age in such state.</em>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Section 3</strong><br>
<em>No person shall be a Senator or Representative in Congress, or elector of President and Vice President, or hold any office, civil or military, under the United States, or under any state, who, having previously taken an oath, as a member of Congress, or as an officer of the United States, or as a member of any state legislature, or as an executive or judicial officer of any state, to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof. But Congress may by a vote of two-thirds of each House, remove such disability.</em>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Section 4</strong><br>
<em>The validity of the public debt of the United States, authorized by law, including debts incurred for payment of pensions and bounties for services in suppressing insurrection or rebellion, shall not be questioned. But neither the United States nor any state shall assume or pay any debt or obligation incurred in aid of insurrection or rebellion against the United States, or any claim for the loss or emancipation of any slave; but all such debts, obligations, and claims shall be held illegal and void.</em>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Section 5</strong><br>
<em>The Congress shall have power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article.</em>
</p>

<h2 id="fifteenthamendment">15th Amendment</h2>
<p>The third of the three 'Reconstruction Amendments' was passed on February 26th, 1869 with ratification occurring on February 3, 1870. It extended the vote to all former slaves and subsequent generations of black citizens, but still denied the vote to all women. Though ratification was required for readmittance of former Confederate states under the Radical Reconstruction plan, voter suppression and intimidation limited its influence after the end of Reconstruction.<br>
<br>
<strong>Section 1</strong><br>
<em>The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied of abridged by the United States or by any State on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude.</em>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Section 2</strong><br>
<em>The Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.</em>
</p> 

<h2 id="twentyfourthamendment">24th Amendment</h2>
<p>Proposed on August 27th, 1962 and ratified by the states on January 23rd, 1964, it prohibits poll taxes from being levied on citizens seeking to vote. The poll tax had been used successfully to suppress voter turnout throughout the South and was held constitutional prior to the 24th Amendment. Due to the economic instability of many blacks in the rural South, a tax on voting was an effective barrier to participation. The Supreme Court ruled in <em>Harper v. Virginia Board of Electors</em> that this ban extended to all elections.<br>
<br>
<strong>Section 1</strong><br>
<em>The right of citizens of the United States to vote in any primary or other election for President or Vice President, for electors for President and Vice President, or for Senator or reason of failure to pay any poll tax or other tax.</em>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Section 2</strong><br>
<em>The Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.</em>

<br>
